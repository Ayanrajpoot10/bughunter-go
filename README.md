## üöÄ Sneak Peek of BugScanX-Go (formerly BugHunter-Go):

Exciting updates are here! We‚Äôve been working hard to make BugScanX-Go the ultimate bug-hunting tool. Here‚Äôs what‚Äôs new:

- **302 Response Removed**: Cleaner output by skipping 302 responses that redirect to recharge portals.
- **All Server Types Saved**: Now saves all server results under the "Others" category, not just Cloudflare, CloudFront, and Akamai. Check out the [example output file](https://t.me/bugscanxchat/28847).
- **More HTTP Methods**: Added support for methods like `GET`, `PATCH`, and `PUT` (default: `HEAD`). You can switch using the `--method` flag.
- **Both HTTP and HTTPS**: Use the `--both-schemes` flag to scan both HTTP and HTTPS at the same time.
- **New PING Scan**: A quick scanning option that‚Äôs faster than other methods.
